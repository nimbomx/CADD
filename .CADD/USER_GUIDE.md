# CADD - Context-Assisted Development Driven

> **Guide for working with AI agents in Cursor using structured methodology**

## What is CADD?

**CADD** is a methodology that allows you to develop software projects using AI agents, regardless of your technical level. It works with **structured context** and **templates** that guide both you and the agent.

### Benefits
- ‚úÖ **Clear instructions** for the agent
- ‚úÖ **Fewer errors** due to lack of context
- ‚úÖ **Organized projects** from the start
- ‚úÖ **Works for any technical level**

## How to Use CADD

### 1. Starting a Conversation
**Whenever you start a new conversation:**

```
Read the file .CADD/START.md
```

The agent will automatically:
- Read the instructions
- Read your preferences
- **NEW**: Detect if you have an existing project
- **NEW**: Analyze your code automatically (if existing project)
- Ask what you want to do
- Guide you according to your response

### 2. Automatic Project Detection (NEW v1.4.2)

#### üîç What Gets Detected
When you add CADD to an existing project, the agent automatically scans for:
- **Technology files**: package.json, requirements.txt, composer.json, etc.
- **Project structure**: src/, app/, components/, lib/, views/ folders
- **Git repository**: Existing .git folder and history
- **Configuration files**: Build tools, linting, testing setup
- **Documentation**: README.md, API docs, comments

#### üß† Automatic Analysis
The agent analyzes your existing code to detect:
- **Technology Stack**: Frontend, backend, database, tools
- **Current Features**: Authentication, CRUD, API endpoints, UI components
- **Architecture**: MVC, microservices, design patterns
- **Code Quality**: Tests, linting, documentation coverage
- **Development Status**: Git activity, version history, team size

#### üìã Auto-Generated Documentation
Based on analysis, the agent automatically creates:
- **Complete PROJECT_PLAN.md** with all detected information
- **Feature inventory** with ‚úÖ checkmarks for existing functionality
- **Technology stack** with versions and dependencies
- **Architecture analysis** with patterns and organization
- **Next phase planning** ready for your input

#### ‚ö° Simplified Setup
For existing projects, you only need to answer 2-3 questions:
1. **Main objective**: What problem does your app solve?
2. **Next phase**: What feature do you want to develop next?
3. **Restrictions**: Any technical or business constraints?

### 3. Workflow

#### üöÄ For New Projects
1. Agent reads START.md
2. Agent reads PREFERENCES.md
3. Agent detects NO existing project files
4. Agent reviews PROJECT_PLAN.md
5. If empty: Asks questions to fill it
6. If has content: Analyzes and complements it
7. Creates development plan
8. Generates first ticket

#### üîç For Existing Projects (NEW)
1. Agent reads START.md
2. Agent reads PREFERENCES.md
3. Agent detects existing project files
4. Agent announces: "Proyecto existente detectado. Analizando c√≥digo..."
5. Agent automatically analyzes codebase
6. Agent auto-fills PROJECT_PLAN.md with detected information
7. Agent asks only 2-3 clarifying questions
8. Ready for immediate development continuation

#### ‚ö° For Continuing Development
1. Agent reads START.md
2. Agent reads PREFERENCES.md
3. Agent reviews PROJECT_PLAN.md
4. Identifies where you left off
5. Continues with next task

#### üìã For Advancing to Next Phase
1. Agent reads START.md
2. Agent reads PREFERENCES.md
3. Reviews progress in PROJECT_PLAN.md
4. Confirms completion of current phase
5. Starts next phase of plan

#### üéØ For New Version
1. Agent reads START.md
2. Agent reads PREFERENCES.md
3. Reviews current version
4. Plans new functionalities
5. Updates PROJECT_PLAN.md

2. ¬øQu√© quieres desarrollar en la pr√≥xima fase?
3. ¬øHay restricciones t√©cnicas importantes?"

User: "Es una app de gesti√≥n de tareas. Quiero a√±adir notificaciones push."
Agent: "Perfect. Metodolog√≠a configurada. ¬øEmpezamos con las notificaciones?"
```

### Example 2: Simple E-commerce (New Project)
```
User: "Read the file .CADD/START.md"
Agent: "No se detect√≥ proyecto existente. Hello [name]! What do you want to do today? A) Create new project..."
User: "A"
Agent: "I see PROJECT_PLAN.md is empty. What type of project is it?"
User: "An online store to sell clothing"
Agent: "Perfect. Who are your target users?"
...
```

### Example 3: Continuing Development
```
User: "Read the file .CADD/START.md"
Agent: "Proyecto ya configurado. Hello [name]! What do you want to do today? A) Create new project..."
User: "B - Continue current phase"
Agent: "I see you're in Phase 2. You completed login. Shall we continue with the shopping cart?"
```

## Tips and Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do This
- **Always** start with "Read the file .CADD/START.md"
- **First time**: Customize PREFERENCES.md with your preferences (v1.4.3)
- **New projects**: Complete PROJECT_PLAN.md template placeholders (v1.4.4)
- **Keep** PROJECT_PLAN.md updated
- **Be specific** in your responses
- **Ask** when you don't understand something
- **Review** generated code
- **NEW**: Trust the automatic analysis - it's usually very accurate
- **NEW**: For existing projects, just answer the 2-3 questions asked
- **NEW**: Check auto-generated PROJECT_PLAN.md to understand what was detected

### ‚ùå Avoid This
- Don't skip the START.md step
- Don't assume the agent remembers previous conversations
- **NEW**: Don't manually fill PROJECT_PLAN.md if you have existing code
- **NEW**: Don't worry about analyzing your own code - let CADD do it
- **NEW**: Don't provide lengthy explanations for existing projects
- Don't modify START.md or TKDD_METHODOLOGY.md
- Don't leave PROJECT_PLAN.md empty for too long
- Don't be afraid to ask questions

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Problems

#### "The agent doesn't understand my project"
**Solution:** Fill PROJECT_PLAN.md with more details about your project

#### "The agent generates incorrect code"
**Solution:** Check if your PREFERENCES.md has the right technical restrictions

#### "I don't know how to continue"
**Solution:** Ask the agent to read PROJECT_PLAN.md and suggest next steps

#### "The agent forgets what we were working on"
**Solution:** Always start with "Read the file .CADD/START.md"

---

## Advanced Tips

### For Teams
- Create a shared PREFERENCES.md with team standards
- Keep PROJECT_PLAN.md updated with all team members
- Use TKDD for assigning tasks to different team members

### For Complex Projects
- Break large projects into smaller sub-projects
- Use multiple PROJECT_PLAN.md files for different modules
- Create custom templates based on your most common project types

### For Learning
- Use CADD to learn new technologies
- Ask the agent to explain generated code
- Create practice projects with increasing complexity

## Git Repository Handling

### For Existing Projects with Git
When you add CADD to an existing project that already has a Git repository, CADD will:

1. **Detect your existing repository** automatically
2. **Show you the current remote** (if any)
3. **Offer three options**:
   - **Keep existing repository** (recommended)
   - **Create new independent repository**
   - **Skip Git setup entirely**

### Option Details

#### Keep Existing Repository ‚úÖ (Recommended)
- **Preserves**: All Git history, branches, remotes, tags
- **Adds**: Only CADD-specific patterns to .gitignore
- **Updates**: README.md with CADD section (preserves existing content)
- **Safe**: No risk of losing any existing work

#### Create New Repository ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Warning**: Disconnects from current remote repository
- **Removes**: All Git history and remote connections
- **Creates**: Fresh repository starting from current state
- **Use case**: When you want to completely break away from original repository

#### Skip Git Setup üö´
- **No Git operations**: CADD doesn't touch Git at all
- **Manual control**: You handle all Git operations yourself
- **Files created**: Only .gitignore and README updates (no Git commands)

### What's Safe
- ‚úÖ **Your code**: Never modified or reorganized
- ‚úÖ **Your Git history**: Preserved unless you choose "Create new"
- ‚úÖ **Your remotes**: Kept intact with "Keep existing" option
- ‚úÖ **Your branches**: All branches preserved
- ‚úÖ **Your workflow**: Enhanced, not replaced

### Best Practices
- **For existing projects**: Always choose "Keep existing repository"
- **For templates/starters**: Consider "Create new repository"
- **For experiments**: Use "Skip Git setup" for full control
