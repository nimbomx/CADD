# CADD - Context-Assisted Development Driven

> **Guide for working with AI agents in Cursor using structured methodology**

## What is CADD?

**CADD** is a methodology that allows you to develop software projects using AI agents, regardless of your technical level. It works with **structured context** and **templates** that guide both you and the agent.

### Benefits
- ‚úÖ **Clear instructions** for the agent
- ‚úÖ **Fewer errors** due to lack of context
- ‚úÖ **Organized projects** from the start
- ‚úÖ **Works for any technical level**

---

## CADD System Files

### üìã START.md
**The starting point for every agent**
- Universal file for any project
- Contains instructions for the agent
- Defines the workflow
- **DO NOT modify** - works for all projects

### ü§ñ PREFERENCES.md
**Your personal preferences**
- How you like to be called
- Preferred response style
- Tools and restrictions
- **YES, customize it** - copied to new projects

### üìù PROJECT_PLAN.md
**The specific description of your project**
- Technical and business information
- Features and timeline
- Current development status
- **YES, modify it** - specific to each project

### üé´ TKDD_METHODOLOGY.md
**Methodology for creating clear tasks**
- Structure for development tickets
- Guide for AI agents
- Avoids ambiguities in instructions
- **DO NOT modify** - universal methodology

---

## How to Use CADD

### 1. Starting a Conversation
**Whenever you start a new conversation:**

```
Read the file .CADD/START.md
```

The agent will automatically:
- Read the instructions
- Read your preferences
- Ask what you want to do
- Guide you according to your response

### 2. Workflow

#### üöÄ For New Projects
1. Agent reads START.md
2. Agent reads PREFERENCES.md
3. Agent reviews PROJECT_PLAN.md
4. If empty: Asks questions to fill it
5. If has content: Analyzes and complements it
6. Creates development plan
7. Generates first ticket

#### ‚ö° For Continuing Development
1. Agent reads START.md
2. Agent reads PREFERENCES.md
3. Agent reviews PROJECT_PLAN.md
4. Identifies where you left off
5. Continues with next task

#### üìã For Advancing to Next Phase
1. Agent reads START.md
2. Agent reads PREFERENCES.md
3. Reviews progress in PROJECT_PLAN.md
4. Confirms completion of current phase
5. Starts next phase of plan

#### üéØ For New Version
1. Agent reads START.md
2. Agent reads PREFERENCES.md
3. Reviews current version
4. Plans new functionalities
5. Updates PROJECT_PLAN.md

#### üîÑ For Existing Projects (NEW!)
1. Agent reads START.md
2. **Automatically detects** existing project files
3. **Analyzes your codebase** (technology, features, structure)
4. **Auto-generates** PROJECT_PLAN.md with detected information
5. **Asks minimal questions** about business goals and next phase
6. **Continues development** using CADD methodology

## Using CADD with Existing Projects

### üîÑ Plug & Play Integration
**NEW FEATURE**: CADD can now automatically analyze and integrate with your existing projects!

### How It Works
1. **Drag and drop** the `.CADD/` folder into your existing project
2. **Start conversation** with "Read the file .CADD/START.md"
3. **Automatic analysis** happens in seconds
4. **Minimal setup** - just answer 2-3 questions
5. **Ready to continue** development with CADD methodology

### What Gets Analyzed
- **Technology Stack**: Frameworks, libraries, versions
- **Project Structure**: Folders, files, organization
- **Features**: Existing functionality from code analysis
- **Architecture**: Patterns, database design, API style
- **Code Quality**: Tests, linting, documentation
- **Git History**: Activity, team size, release cadence

### Example: Existing React App
```
User: "Read the file .CADD/START.md"
Agent: "Existing project detected! Analyzing codebase..."
       "‚úÖ React 18 + TypeScript + Node.js detected"
       "‚úÖ Found 15 components, 8 API endpoints"
       "‚úÖ 78% test coverage, ESLint configured"
       "‚úÖ PROJECT_PLAN.md auto-generated"
       
       "Just need to clarify:"
       "1. What's the main purpose of your app?"
       "2. What do you want to develop next?"

User: "It's a task manager. I want to add team collaboration features."
Agent: "Perfect! I've set up your next development phase. Ready to create the first ticket?"
```

### Benefits for Existing Projects
- **No Disruption**: Doesn't change your existing code or structure
- **Smart Integration**: Learns from your existing patterns
- **Instant Value**: Ready to use immediately
- **Respects Your Work**: Preserves everything you've built

### What You Keep
- ‚úÖ **All your existing code** (unchanged)
- ‚úÖ **Your folder structure** (preserved)
- ‚úÖ **Your Git history** (intact)
- ‚úÖ **Your build process** (continues working)
- ‚úÖ **Your team workflow** (enhanced, not replaced)

### What You Get
- ‚úÖ **Structured development** with TKDD methodology
- ‚úÖ **Better project documentation** (auto-generated)
- ‚úÖ **Organized ticket system** for future development
- ‚úÖ **AI-friendly project context** for better assistance
- ‚úÖ **Phase-based development** planning

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple E-commerce
```
User: "Read the file .CADD/START.md"
Agent: "Hello [name]! What do you want to do today? A) Create new project..."
User: "A"
Agent: "I see PROJECT_PLAN.md is empty. What type of project is it?"
User: "An online store to sell clothing"
Agent: "Perfect. Who are your target users?"
...
```

### Example 2: Continuing Development
```
User: "Read the file .CADD/START.md"
Agent: "Hello [name]! What do you want to do today? A) Create new project..."
User: "B - Continue current phase"
Agent: "I see you're in Phase 2. You completed login. Shall we continue with the shopping cart?"
```

### Example 3: Existing Project Integration (NEW!)
```
User: "Read the file .CADD/START.md"
Agent: "Existing project detected! Analyzing codebase..."
       "‚úÖ Technology Stack: React 18, Node.js, PostgreSQL"
       "‚úÖ Features: Auth, CRUD, Dashboard (15 components)"
       "‚úÖ Quality: 82% test coverage, ESLint configured"
       "‚úÖ PROJECT_PLAN.md auto-generated"
       
       "Just need to clarify:"
       "1. What's the main purpose of this application?"
       "2. What do you want to develop in the next phase?"

User: "1. It's a customer management system for small businesses"
      "2. I want to add invoice generation and payment processing"

Agent: "Perfect! I've updated your PROJECT_PLAN.md with this information."
       "Your project is now set up with CADD methodology."
       "Ready to create the first ticket for invoice generation?"
```

## Tips and Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do This
- **Always** start with "Read the file .CADD/START.md"
- **Customize** PREFERENCES.md with your preferences
- **Keep** PROJECT_PLAN.md updated
- **Be specific** in your responses
- **Ask** when you don't understand something
- **Review** generated code

### ‚ùå Avoid This
- Don't skip the START.md step
- Don't assume the agent remembers previous conversations
- Don't modify START.md or TKDD_METHODOLOGY.md
- Don't leave PROJECT_PLAN.md empty for too long
- Don't be afraid to ask questions

### üîÑ For Existing Projects
#### ‚úÖ Do This
- **Trust the auto-analysis** - it's usually very accurate
- **Provide context** about business goals and next phase
- **Review the generated PROJECT_PLAN.md** - correct if needed
- **Start with simple tickets** to test the integration
- **Gradually adopt** CADD methodology
- **Keep your existing workflow** - CADD enhances, doesn't replace

#### ‚ùå Avoid This
- Don't worry about changing your existing code structure
- Don't feel pressure to reorganize everything
- Don't skip the clarification questions
- Don't assume the analysis captured everything perfectly
- Don't try to migrate everything at once

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Problems

#### "The agent doesn't understand my project"
**Solution:** Fill PROJECT_PLAN.md with more details about your project

#### "The agent generates incorrect code"
**Solution:** Check if your PREFERENCES.md has the right technical restrictions

#### "I don't know how to continue"
**Solution:** Ask the agent to read PROJECT_PLAN.md and suggest next steps

#### "The agent forgets what we were working on"
**Solution:** Always start with "Read the file .CADD/START.md"

### For Existing Projects

#### "The agent didn't detect my project correctly"
**Solution:** Check if you have package.json, requirements.txt, or other technology files in your project root

#### "The auto-analysis missed important features"
**Solution:** Review and edit the generated PROJECT_PLAN.md to add missing information

#### "I don't want to change my existing structure"
**Solution:** Perfect! CADD preserves your existing structure - it only adds `.CADD/` folder and `/tickets/`

#### "The agent wants to reorganize my code"
**Solution:** Remind the agent that this is an existing project and to preserve the current structure
