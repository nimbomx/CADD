# START - Universal Starting Point for Agents

## Instructions for Agent

**READ THIS FILE ALWAYS AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH CONVERSATION**

### What is CADD?
**Context-Assisted Development Driven** - Methodology for AI-assisted development using structured context.

### CADD System Files
1. **START.md** - This file. Universal starting point
2. **PREFERENCES.md** - User's personal preferences
3. **PROJECT_PLAN.md** - Project-specific description
4. **TKDD_METHODOLOGY.md** - TKDD methodology for tickets
5. **USER_GUIDE.md** - User guide for the methodology

---

## Agent Workflow

### 0. MANDATORY PRIOR ACTION
**BEFORE** doing anything, read PREFERENCES.md:

```
1. Read PREFERENCES.md to understand user preferences
2. Apply those preferences throughout the conversation
3. If first time, ask if they need to update PREFERENCES.md
```

### 1. MANDATORY FIRST CHECK - EXISTING PROJECT DETECTION
**BEFORE** asking "What do you want to do today?", **ALWAYS** check for existing project:

```
1. SCAN current directory for existing project indicators:
   - package.json, requirements.txt, composer.json, Gemfile, go.mod
   - Common project folders: src/, app/, components/, lib/, views/
   - Git repository (.git folder)
   - README.md or documentation files
   - Configuration files: webpack.config.js, vite.config.js, etc.

2. IF EXISTING PROJECT DETECTED:
   - ANNOUNCE: "Proyecto existente detectado. Analizando c√≥digo..."
   - EXECUTE: Automatic Project Analysis (see section below)
   - FILL: PROJECT_PLAN.md with analyzed information
   - ASK: Only for missing critical information
   - PROCEED: To simplified workflow

3. IF NO EXISTING PROJECT: Continue with standard workflow
```

### 2. AUTOMATIC PROJECT ANALYSIS (for existing projects)
When existing project is detected, execute this comprehensive analysis:

#### Technology Stack Detection
- **Frontend**: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, vanilla JS from package.json dependencies
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python, PHP, Java, C#, Go, Ruby from files and dependencies
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite from connection strings/ORMs
- **Mobile**: React Native, Flutter, Swift, Kotlin from project structure
- **Build Tools**: Webpack, Vite, Rollup, Parcel from config files
- **Testing**: Jest, Mocha, Cypress, Playwright from dependencies

#### Project Structure Analysis
- **Folder Purpose**: Identify src/, components/, utils/, api/, models/, views/
- **Architecture Pattern**: MVC, microservices, monolithic from structure
- **Code Organization**: Naming conventions, file structure patterns
- **Configuration**: Environment files, build configs, linting setup

#### Feature Detection
- **Authentication**: Login/register components, JWT/OAuth patterns
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete patterns in code
- **API Endpoints**: REST routes, GraphQL schemas, WebSocket connections
- **UI Components**: Forms, tables, modals, navigation elements
- **Business Logic**: Data validation, processing, workflow patterns

#### Code Quality Assessment
- **Testing**: Test files, coverage reports, testing framework setup
- **Linting**: ESLint, Prettier, other code quality tools

#### Git Activity Analysis
- **Repository Status**: Active development, last commits, branch structure
- **Team Size**: Commit authors, development patterns
- **Release History**: Tags, versions, changelog patterns
- **Development Stage**: Early, active, mature, maintenance

### 3. AUTO-FILL PROJECT_PLAN.md
Based on automatic analysis, populate PROJECT_PLAN.md with:

```markdown

   - **Preserve Git History**: Keep all existing commits, branches, and remotes
   - **Add CADD Files**: Stage .CADD/ folder and tickets/ structure
   - **ASK USER**: "Do you want me to commit these CADD additions?" (show files to be committed)
   - **IF YES**: Create commit with meaningful message about CADD integration
   - **IF NO**: Leave files staged for user to commit manually

4. **If Create New Repository (Option B)**:
   - **WARNING**: Explain this will disconnect from original repository
   - **ASK CONFIRMATION**: "This will remove connection to [remote-url]. All Git history will be lost. Continue?"
   - **IF YES**: 
     - Remove .git/ folder completely
     - Generate fresh .gitignore based on PROJECT_PLAN.md technology stack
     - Generate comprehensive README.md from PROJECT_PLAN.md

     - **IF YES**: Create initial commit with all project files
     - **IF NO**: Leave files untracked for user to commit manually
   - **IF NO**: Return to Option A or C

5. **If Skip Git Setup (Option C)**:
   - **Generate .gitignore**: Create .gitignore file without Git operations
   - **Generate README.md**: Create or update README without Git
   - **Leave Git Management**: Entirely to user's discretion
   - **Note**: User can run Git setup later if desired

### .gitignore Template Generation
