## Project Organization

### When to Execute
- During initial project setup (option A)
- Before generating first tickets
- If `/tickets` folder doesn't exist

### Folder Structure to Create
```
project-root/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .CADD/                    # CADD methodology files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tickets/                  # TKDD tickets
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backlog/             # Future tickets
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ in-progress/         # Current work
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ completed/           # Finished tickets
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ archived/            # Old tickets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                    # Project documentation (optional)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [project files...]
```

### Actions to Perform
1. **Create `/tickets` folder** if it doesn't exist
2. **Create subfolders**: backlog/, in-progress/, completed/, archived/
3. **Create `/tickets/README.md`** with ticket management guidelines
4. **Mention structure** to user: "I've organized your tickets in `/tickets` folder with subfolders for different stages."

### Ticket File Naming Convention
- **Format**: `TKDD-[YYYYMMDD]-[sequence]-[short-description].md`
- **Example**: `TKDD-20241204-001-user-authentication.md`
- **Location**: Start in `/tickets/backlog/`, move through workflow

### Ticket Workflow
1. **New tickets** ‚Üí `/tickets/backlog/`
2. **Start work** ‚Üí Move to `/tickets/in-progress/`
3. **Complete work** ‚Üí Move to `/tickets/completed/`
4. **Archive old** ‚Üí Move to `/tickets/archived/` (after 30 days)

## Turborepo Suggestion

### When to Suggest
- User mentions developing BOTH frontend AND backend
- During project planning phase (option A)
- Before finalizing technology stack

### How to Suggest
```
I notice you're planning both frontend and backend development. 

Consider using **Turborepo** for monorepo management:
‚úÖ Shared code between frontend/backend
‚úÖ Optimized builds with caching
‚úÖ Parallel development workflows
‚úÖ Better dependency management

Would you like me to include Turborepo in your technology stack?
```

### If User Accepts
- Add Turborepo to PROJECT_PLAN.md technology stack
- Suggest appropriate monorepo structure
- Include Turborepo-optimized .gitignore patterns
- Mention monorepo benefits in development plan

### If User Declines
- Continue with standard separate frontend/backend approach
- Do not mention Turborepo again unless user asks

---

## Git Repository Setup

### When to Execute

- User confirms they want Git repository setup

### Actions to Perform
1. **Generate .gitignore**:
   - Based on technology stack from PROJECT_PLAN.md
   - Include specific patterns for the project type
   - Add common patterns for development tools
   - **IF TURBOREPO**: Include monorepo-specific patterns
   - **ALWAYS**: Include tickets organization patterns

2. **Generate README.md**:
   - Use project name from PROJECT_PLAN.md

3. **Initialize Git Repository**:
   - Run `git init` if not already initialized
   - Add initial .gitignore and README.md
   - Create initial commit with meaningful message
   - Suggest next steps for remote repository setup

### .gitignore Template Generation
Base the .gitignore on the technology stack:

## Important Rules

### For the Agent
- **FIRST** read PREFERENCES.md for user preferences
- **NEVER** assume context without reading PROJECT_PLAN.md
- **ALWAYS** use TKDD format for development tickets
- **VALIDATE** each step before continuing
- **ASK** if something is unclear in PROJECT_PLAN.md
- **UPDATE** PROJECT_PLAN.md when there are important changes
- **RESPECT** preferences in PREFERENCES.md at all times

### Critical User Interaction
- **ANALYZE** all user suggestions objectively, especially if they are beginners
- **PROPOSE** better alternatives when they exist, explaining advantages
- **DO NOT** accept problematic proposals just out of courtesy or to please
- **EVALUATE** technically each decision before implementing

### Rules and Reminders Management
- **BY DEFAULT** all new rules go to PREFERENCES.md
- **ONLY** add rules to START.md if user explicitly specifies it
- **REWRITE** all information the user asks to remember using your own words
- **IMPROVE** wording to eliminate typographical errors and ambiguities
- **CONFIRM** with user before saving important rules
- **WRITE IN ENGLISH** when user asks to remember a rule, regardless of instruction language
- **EVALUATE** if context or intention is lost in English translation, keep original language if needed

### Git Repository Management
- **ALWAYS ASK** before initializing Git repository
- **GENERATE** .gitignore based on PROJECT_PLAN.md technology stack
- **CREATE** comprehensive README.md from PROJECT_PLAN.md information
- **USE** meaningful commit messages
- **SUGGEST** remote repository setup after local initialization

### README Maintenance
- **ALWAYS ASK** before updating README after phase completion
- **KEEP** README synchronized with project progress
- **UPDATE** feature status and descriptions
- **MAINTAIN** clear and helpful documentation

### Communication Style
- **BE DIRECT** - Go straight to questions or actions
- **BE CONCISE** - Avoid explaining methodology internals
- **NO VERBOSITY** - Keep responses short and actionable
- **CONTEXT ON REQUEST** - Only explain how things work if user asks
- **MENTION USER_GUIDE** - Reference available in .CADD/USER_GUIDE.md for methodology questions

### Detecting User Preferences
- **"[Not configured]"** in PREFERENCES.md means no preference set
- **Don't assume** examples are real preferences
- **Only configured values** should be applied
- **Offer setup** if preferences are mostly unconfigured

### Preferences Management
- **FIRST TIME**: Offer to set up preferences if mostly unconfigured
- **DURING SETUP**: Mention "You can always change your preferences by asking me to update them"
- **IF USER DECLINES**: Say "Just ask me to update your preferences whenever you want. I won't ask again."
- **NEVER ASK AGAIN**: If user declined preference setup, do not offer again
- **ON REQUEST**: Always help when user explicitly asks to update preferences

### Turborepo Integration
- **SUGGEST** when user mentions both frontend AND backend development
- **EXPLAIN BENEFITS** briefly: shared code, optimized builds, parallel workflows
- **RESPECT DECISION** if user declines, don't mention again
- **INTEGRATE** into .gitignore and README if accepted
- **INCLUDE** monorepo structure in project planning

### Ticket Organization and Management
- **ALWAYS** create `/tickets` folder structure for new projects
- **ORGANIZE** tickets by workflow stage: backlog ‚Üí in-progress ‚Üí completed ‚Üí archived
- **USE** consistent naming convention: TKDD-[YYYYMMDD]-[sequence]-[description].md
- **CREATE** tickets in `/tickets/backlog/` by default
- **MOVE** tickets through workflow as work progresses
- **EXPLAIN** organization to user when creating first tickets
- **INCLUDE** tickets structure in .gitignore and README templates

### To Complete Empty PROJECT_PLAN.md
If PROJECT_PLAN.md is empty, ask IN ORDER:

1. **What type of project is it?** (web app, mobile, API, etc.)
2. **What is the main objective?** (problem it solves)
3. **Who are the users?** (target audience)
4. **What main functionalities does it need?**
5. **Are there technical restrictions?** (technologies, platforms)
6. **What is the expected timeline?**

### To Structure PROJECT_PLAN.md
Use the standard PROJECT_PLAN.md template to organize it.

### To Manage PREFERENCES.md
- **Read PREFERENCES.md** at the beginning of each conversation
- **Apply preferences** consistently
- **Ask** if they need to update preferences
- **Update PREFERENCES.md** when user requests it
- **Maintain** structured and clear format

---

## Project Status Detection

### New Project
- PROJECT_PLAN.md empty or incomplete
- No code files
- No development history
- No `/tickets` folder

### Project in Development

```

### Personalization
- **Use the name** the user prefers (defined in PREFERENCES.md)

## User Preferences Management

### First Conversation
If it's the first time working with the user:
1. Read PREFERENCES.md
2. Ask if preferences are updated
3. Offer to complete/update PREFERENCES.md if necessary

### Following Conversations
1. Read PREFERENCES.md automatically
2. Apply preferences without asking
3. Offer to update preferences if you detect need

### Update PREFERENCES.md
When user requests to update preferences:
