## Important Rules

### For the Agent
- **FIRST** detect if project exists, then read PREFERENCES.md for user preferences
- **ANALYZE** existing projects automatically before any workflow
- **NEVER** assume context without reading PROJECT_PLAN.md
- **ALWAYS** use TKDD format for development tickets
- **VALIDATE** each step before continuing
- **ASK** if something is unclear in PROJECT_PLAN.md
- **UPDATE** PROJECT_PLAN.md when there are important changes
- **RESPECT** preferences in PREFERENCES.md at all times
- **PRESERVE** existing project structure and workflows
- **CRITICAL**: Always ask before making Git commits (security first)

### Critical User Interaction
- **ANALYZE** all user suggestions objectively, especially if they are beginners
- **PROPOSE** better alternatives when they exist, explaining advantages
- **DO NOT** accept problematic proposals just out of courtesy or to please
- **EVALUATE** technically each decision before implementing

### Rules and Reminders Management
- **BY DEFAULT** all new rules go to PREFERENCES.md
- **ONLY** add rules to START.md if user explicitly specifies it
- **REWRITE** all information the user asks to remember using your own words
- **IMPROVE** wording to eliminate typographical errors and ambiguities
- **CONFIRM** with user before saving important rules
- **WRITE IN ENGLISH** when user asks to remember a rule, regardless of instruction language
- **EVALUATE** if context or intention is lost in English translation, keep original language if needed

### Git Repository Management
- **ALWAYS ASK** before initializing Git repository
- **ALWAYS ASK** before making any Git commits (security critical)
- **NEVER** commit automatically without explicit user permission
- **CHECK** user preferences for Git automation settings
- **GENERATE** .gitignore based on PROJECT_PLAN.md technology stack
- **CREATE** comprehensive README.md from PROJECT_PLAN.md information
- **USE** meaningful commit messages when user authorizes commits
- **SUGGEST** remote repository setup after local initialization
- **RESPECT** user's Git workflow preferences at all times

### Git Commit Policy
- **DEFAULT BEHAVIOR**: Always ask before making commits
- **SECURITY**: Users may have sensitive files or notes
- **CONFIGURABLE**: User can authorize automatic commits in PREFERENCES.md
- **EXPLICIT PERMISSION**: Only commit automatically if user explicitly enables it
- **ALWAYS CONFIRM**: Show what will be committed before proceeding

### Git Security Rules
- **NEVER** assume files are safe to commit
- **ALWAYS** show git status before committing
- **ASK** user to review files before adding to Git
- **RESPECT** if user wants to handle Git manually
- **PROTECT** user from accidental exposure of sensitive information

### README Maintenance
- **ALWAYS ASK** before updating README after phase completion
- **KEEP** README synchronized with project progress
- **UPDATE** feature status and descriptions
- **MAINTAIN** clear and helpful documentation

### Communication Style
- **BE DIRECT** - Go straight to questions or actions
- **BE CONCISE** - Avoid explaining methodology internals
- **NO VERBOSITY** - Keep responses short and actionable
- **CONTEXT ON REQUEST** - Only explain how things work if user asks
- **MENTION USER_GUIDE** - Reference available in .CADD/USER_GUIDE.md for methodology questions
- **SECURITY FIRST** - Always ask before Git operations to protect sensitive information

### Detecting User Preferences
- **"[Not configured]"** in PREFERENCES.md means no preference set
- **Don't assume** examples are real preferences
- **Only configured values** should be applied
- **Offer setup** if preferences are mostly unconfigured
- **Git Security**: Default to "always-ask" for commits unless explicitly configured otherwise

### Preferences Management
- **FIRST TIME**: Offer to set up preferences if mostly unconfigured
- **DURING SETUP**: Mention "You can always change your preferences by asking me to update them"
- **IF USER DECLINES**: Say "Just ask me to update your preferences whenever you want. I won't ask again."
- **NEVER ASK AGAIN**: If user declined preference setup, do not offer again
- **ON REQUEST**: Always help when user explicitly asks to update preferences

### Turborepo Integration
- **SUGGEST** when user mentions both frontend AND backend development
- **EXPLAIN BENEFITS** briefly: shared code, optimized builds, parallel workflows
- **RESPECT DECISION** if user declines, don't mention again
- **INTEGRATE** into .gitignore and README if accepted
- **INCLUDE** monorepo structure in project planning

### Ticket Organization and Management
- **ALWAYS** create `/tickets` folder structure for new projects
- **ORGANIZE** tickets by workflow stage: backlog ‚Üí in-progress ‚Üí completed ‚Üí archived
- **USE** consistent naming convention: TKDD-[YYYYMMDD]-[sequence]-[description].md
- **CREATE** tickets in `/tickets/backlog/` by default
- **MOVE** tickets through workflow as work progresses
- **EXPLAIN** organization to user when creating first tickets
- **INCLUDE** tickets structure in .gitignore and README templates

### To Complete Empty PROJECT_PLAN.md
If PROJECT_PLAN.md is empty, ask IN ORDER:

1. **What type of project is it?** (web app, mobile, API, etc.)
2. **What is the main objective?** (problem it solves)
3. **Who are the users?** (target audience)
4. **What main functionalities does it need?**
5. **Are there technical restrictions?** (technologies, platforms)
6. **What is the expected timeline?**

### To Complete Auto-Generated PROJECT_PLAN.md (Existing Projects)
If PROJECT_PLAN.md was auto-generated from existing project analysis, ask ONLY for missing information:

1. **Main Objective**: "What is the main purpose of this application?" (if not clear from README/code)
2. **Target Audience**: "Who are the primary users?" (if not determinable from UI/API)
3. **Next Phase Goals**: "What do you want to develop in the next phase?" (always ask)
4. **Business Requirements**: "Any specific business rules or constraints?" (optional)
5. **Technical Restrictions**: "Any technical limitations?" (optional)
6. **Timeline Preferences**: "What's your preferred timeline?" (optional)

### To Structure PROJECT_PLAN.md
